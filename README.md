# Express-Ts üíªÔ∏è
The backend application developed with Node.js and TypeScript uses MongoDB as the database to manage users, groups, and their relationships. Its main objective is to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for users and groups, in addition to handling user authentication and authorization.

## Key Features: 
### Data Models
User: Defines fields such as name, email, password, and their associations with groups.
Group: Describes the structure of groups, including their name and associated users.
### CRUD Functionalities
Users: Enables complete user management, ensuring validations for data integrity.
Groups: Offers similar operations for group management, including manipulation of their associated users.
### Association Management
User-Group Association: Facilitates adding and removing users from specific groups.
### Specific Queries
List of Users in Groups: An endpoint to retrieve the list of users associated with a particular group.
List of Groups per User: Provides a list of groups to which a user is associated.
### Authentication and Authorization
Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
Implements middleware to authorize routes and specific actions, restricting access to authorized roles, such as the superadmin role for user creation.
